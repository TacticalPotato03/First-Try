        Hi, I'm Travis and this is my small corner of the internet where I write about
        building things, thinking out loud, and shipping ideas before they're ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this site from my phone using Claude Code, which I think says something
        about where we are right now. The tools have finally caught up to the ideas, and
        when the friction between an initial thought and execution is nearly zero, things
        get interesting. This blog is a living record of that: the intersection of technology,
        craft, and whatever else is on my mind. No editorial calendar, no polished strategy,
        just honest notes from someone building in public.
      </p>

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        Professionally, I'm a commercial leader with over 15 years of experience scaling
        SaaS growth across mid-market and enterprise segments. My career has been defined
        by building international teams and go-to-market strategies that are as data-driven
        as they are human-centric.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I lead sales and GTM strategy at
        <a href="https://zensai.com/">Zensai</a> across Northern Europe. My team helps
        organizations bridge the gap between potential and performance. By integrating
        learning, performance management, and employee engagement directly into the
        Microsoft ecosystem (M365, Teams, and Copilot), we drive real professional success
        for real people.
      </p>

      <h2>A bit more about me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an American living in Denmark with my wife and three kids, and that multicultural
        lens carries over into my work. Fluent in English, German, and Danish, I thrive
        where commercial ambition, technology, and people intersect to create scalable growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe modern leadership is about blending hands-on coaching with intelligent
        systems, and I'm passionate about turning technical capability into clear commercial
        value.
