        Hi, I'm Travis Campbell. This is my small corner of the internet where I write about
        building things, thinking out loud, and shipping ideas before they're ready.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started this site from my phone using Claude Code — which I think says something
        about what's possible now. The tools have gotten good enough that the friction between
        idea and execution is nearly zero. That excites me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I write about the intersection of technology, craft, and whatever's on my mind.
        No editorial calendar. No strategy. Just honest notes from someone building in public.
      </p>
